# Developer Manual — BookTrack

## Overview
BookTrack is a full-stack web application built with a JavaScript-based front end and a Node.js backend. The backend exposes a REST API that communicates with a Supabase PostgreSQL database. The front end consumes all data using the Fetch API and renders content dynamically in the browser.

This document provides instructions for setting up, running, and extending the application.
